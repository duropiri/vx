                  Cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing

                  subscription benefits until the term ends.

                        General Policy: VX operates under a policy where service

                        If a client does not see tangible progress in their
                        social media growth or engagement metrics as agreed in
                        their contract and demonstrates adherence to the

                        on a case-by-case basis.
                        <br />
                        Refund requests should be submitted within 14 days after
                        the first month of service delivery​​.

                        <br />
                        Refunds are not provided for partial periods of service
                        after a full month has commenced.

                        and seen, or specialized strategies already implemented
                        are not eligible for refunds due to their proprietary
                        nature​​.
                        <br />
                        How to Request a Refund: Clients must submit refund
                        requests in writing via [specific contact method: email,
                        support portal, etc.], clearly stating the reasons for
                        dissatisfaction and providing relevant details. VX will

                        within the stipulated period, clients may opt for
